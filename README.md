# Class booking project

### Using Docker

In order to use this workflow for development, you must first [install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).

Then, you can run project by `cd`ing into the project's `docker/dev` folder and running `docker-compose up`.

To stop the project, run `docker-compose down`.
